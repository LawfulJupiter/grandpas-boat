    <h1>Grandpa's Old Boat</h1>
    <img src="images/boat-floating.jpg" alt="The old boat floating in the water.">
    <p>Grandpa got this boat from his father. The two of them used to go fishing together when Grandpa was a small boy. Grandpa loves to take us out fishing in it. Some of our favorite lakes to visit include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ottertail Lake</li>
        <li>Hoot Lake</li>
        <li>Lee Lake</li>
        <li>Jewett Lake</li>
        <li>Turtle Lake</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At the end of next season, Grandpa is going to donate his boat to the <a href="https://legacyofthelakes.org/" target="_blank">Legacy of the Lakes</a> museum in Alexandria, MN</p>
